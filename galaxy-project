None of these options
It is a minimum standard to allow computational research to be reviewed and inspected
All of these options
Yes, modern software platforms (including Galaxy) were created to help researchers meet these challenges

All of these options
Provides an environment for researchers to easily use existing bioinformatic software and record and share the results
An email account and a web browser
All of these options
Is highly configurable for many types of compute infrastructure

1 The Tool Panel

9 All of these options
10 Edit a dataset’s contents
11 1720
12 1510
13 An abstract representation of a multi-step analysis
14 All of these options
15 Galaxy allows sending workflow data to a new history
16 Both of these options
17 An item can have more than one of them
18 They can contain arbitrary free form text
19 All of these options
20 Only certain users will be able to access it
21 The history will be listed in a central, public place within Galaxy and all users can access it
22 The email associated with the user's Galaxy account
23 Anyone who knows the URL (the browser address)
24 Shared Data -> Published Histories
25 From the same interface used to make it accessible: use the 'Share or Publish' link in the history options
26 All of these options
27 They can be used to describe why an analysis was performed in a particular way
28 Another way to share data and make it easy to find

Four
All of these options
Ion torrent
All of these options
Per sequence base quality
Depends on tools used during downstream analysis.
The locations of protein to DNA interaction
Peek calling/reconstruction from ChIP-seq data
Both options

1. What does it mean to align-then-assemble? 
Align reads to an existing reference genome, and then assemble transcripts from the spliced alignments.
2. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
De-novo assembly is not robust to variation
3. What of following formats can tophat results produce? 
A) BED format.
B) ADAM format.
C) BAM format.
A and C
4. Which tool in the cufflinks suite is used to find the differentially expressed genes?
Cuffdiff
5. One of the options is NOT a column in the output produced by Cuffdiff.
Length of the differentially expressed gene
6. What is the main purpose of Cuffmerge and what is its input format?
To merge different Cufflinks assemblies together and GTF files.
7. Can we use Galaxy to run the same tophat (or other tool) job over Multiple datasets?
Yes, the datasets need to be of the format the tool can take as input.
8. What Galaxy tool might we use to refine our Cuffdiff output to show only differentially expressed genes?
Filter
9. What comes after mapping the RNA seq data to a reference genome?
Using a reference annotation we continue to do differential expression analysis using the Cufflinks suite.
10. What is the idea behind setting the tool form “Use Reference Annotation” to “reference annotation as guide” in Cufflinks?
A) Tells Cufflinks to use the reference annotation to guide the assembly.
B) Results will contain referenced transcripts, novel genes and isoforms.
C) Tells Cufflinks to remove all unannotated transcripts.
A and B
11. What does the “log2(fold change)” in the gene differential expression testing result mean?
A) Its the log-ratio of FPKM values for a pair of expressed genes.
B) Its the log-ratio between mapped and unmapped reads.
C) It indicates genes with significantly different expression profiles.
A and C

1. Why would you use a virtual environment (virtualenv) when installing Galaxy?
Ensures that the Galaxy environment is isolated from anything else installed on your system.
2. Which file would you edit to add an administrative user to galaxy?
galaxy.ini
3. What is the standard way to start the Galaxy server?
sh run.sh
4. How is Galaxy primarily distributed?
Git
5. What’s the easiest way to find and add new tools to your Galaxy instance?
Tool Shed
6. Which Amazon Web Services do we use with Galaxy Cloudlaunch?
All of these options
7. Which of the following statements about access keys and security is not true?
If you lose your cloudman_keypair.pem you can just download it again
8. What’s an easy and reproducible way to share the work you’ve done on a Galaxy Cloudman Cluster?
Use Cloudman’s cluster sharing function and make the share string available
9. Which of these do we not need to simply launch a cluster and use it through the web interface?
cloudman_keypair.pem
10. Of the following instance types, what’s the most expensive type of instance to run based on the per hour usage cost?
r3.4xlarge
